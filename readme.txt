The plugin allows authors to rank list of anything and display the table of rankings in posts or pages. List can be resued to create multiple rankings. 

== Description ==

The plugin allows authors to rank and list ANYTHING and display the table of rankings in posts or pages. Authors can create comments when they create rankings which are displayed below the rankings / list in the wordpress post or page. Created with sports teams and athlete list / rankings in mind, but can be used for anything you want to easily list or rank. We came up with this idea to help multiple authors list / rank players on our fantasy football website. We've seen people use this to rank the top sports teams and players for fantasy baseball and fantasy basketball too. 

= Key features: =

* Upload or manually create default list to be used on any rankings / list you desire. 
* Multiple Authors
* Composite of all authors list / rankings
* Show <a href="https://gravatar.com/?">Gravatar</a> for Authors above their name and rankings / list table.
* Users can sort rankings in the post for each author, default order is based on composite.
* Set default rank order for authors when created list.
* Drag and drop items being ranked (wordpress admin area)
* Upload csv list of items (players) or manually enter them.
* Three custom fields for adding information about items being ranked. example: Player Name, Team, Position

Admins can create player lists and rankers. Authors can only rank players.


Useful for rankings and list of anything you desire but optimized for ranking athletes. For example: You can upload (or manually create) a list of NFL players then authors can sort those rankings in post or pages. You can create top 10 list, top 100 list, top 10 rankings etc for NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL players with ease! Fantasy Football websites will find this extremely useful when creating <a href="http://fantasyknuckleheads.com/fantasy-football-rankings/" title="fantasy football rankings">fantasy football rankings</a> for the draft and weekly matchups. 

We use custom post types to create list and rankings.
